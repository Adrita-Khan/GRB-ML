### **Features / Variables**

From **Table 1**:

### **Sample Size**

After selection and cleaning:

2. **Standardization (Z-score normalization):** Ensured zero mean and unit variance across features.
3. **Filtering Criteria:**

   * Removed GRBs with >100% uncertainty in spectral parameters.
   * Removed GRBs lacking Ep values across all models.
   * Excluded Band-fitted GRBs with Î² â‰¥ âˆ’2 (indicating no spectral peak).
   * Excluded short GRBs (SGRBs) to focus on long GRBs (LGRBs).
4. **Separate datasets** prepared for **Band**, **Comptonized**, and combined models.

---

### **Application in the Study**

* Dataset used to **train Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)** with regression setup, targeting redshift prediction.
* Predictions were combined in a **stacking ensemble** with Random Forest as the meta-learner.
* Applied to GBM GRBs without measured z to estimate pseudo-redshifts.
* Validated against **Amati** and **Yonetoku** correlations to check astrophysical consistency.

---

### **Limitations**

* **Small training sample:** Only \~460 GRBs with spectroscopic redshifts available.
* **Selection bias:** Redshift measurements require optical follow-up, favoring brighter or closer bursts.
* **Spectral model dependence:** Band vs. Compton fits can yield different parameter estimates.
* **Energy coverage mismatch:** GBM (8â€“1000 keV) vs. KW (80â€“1200 keV).
* **Excluded data:** GRBs with large parameter errors or missing spectral peak information.
* **Range limitations:** Model predictions more reliable within z â‰ˆ 0.5â€“6, reflecting training sample distribution.

âœ… In summary:
The dataset consisted of **Fermi-GBM (2008â€“2018) and Konus-Wind (2005â€“2018) GRBs with known redshifts (\~460 bursts)**, curated using strict selection criteria and spectral fitting (Band/Comptonized). Features included duration, spectral parameters, flux, and fluence. Preprocessing involved log transformation, standardization, and error-based filtering. This curated dataset trained DNN + Random Forest ensemble models to estimate redshift for **>1700 GRBs without measured z**, later validated against astrophysical correlations.

# Dataset Description for "Deep Neural Networks for Estimation of Gamma-Ray Burst Redshifts"

## Overview

The dataset used in this study combines **Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB)** observations from two major space-based instruments to train machine learning models for redshift estimation. The research focuses specifically on **Long Gamma-Ray Bursts (LGRBs)** with well-measured spectral parameters and known redshifts.[1][2]

## Data Sources

### Primary Instruments

**Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (Fermi-GBM)**
- **Sample Size**: 127 LGRBs with measured redshift information[1]
- **Energy Range**: 8-1000 keV for spectral fitting[1]
- **Time Period**: Data spans from 2008 to at least 2022[3]
- **Total GBM Catalog**: Contains more than 3,000 events, with approximately 16% classified as Short GRBs[1]

**Konus-Wind (KW)**
- **Sample Size**: 338 LGRBs with measured redshift information[1]
- **Energy Range**: 80-1200 keV for spectral fitting[1]
- **Time Period**: 2005 to 2018[1]
- **Detector Configuration**: Two identical detectors (S1 and S2) with response functions calculated for 5 keV - 10 MeV[4]

### Combined Training Dataset
- **Total Training Sample**: 465 LGRBs (127 from GBM + 338 from KW)[1]
- **Redshift Range**: Up to z = 8.2[1]
- **Quality Criteria**: All bursts have well-measured prompt gamma-ray flux and spectral information[2][1]

## Dataset Features and Variables

### Spectral Parameters

The study utilizes spectral fitting parameters obtained from two primary spectral models:[1]

**Band Model Parameters**:[5][6]
- Low-energy photon index (Î±)
- High-energy photon index (Î²) 
- Peak energy (E_peak) in the Î½FÎ½ spectrum
- Amplitude/normalization factor

**Comptonized Model Parameters**:[6][5]
- Power-law index
- Peak energy (E_peak)
- Exponential cutoff energy
- Flux normalization

### Observable Quantities

**Temporal Characteristics**:
- **Tâ‚‰â‚€**: Duration of the burst (time interval containing 90% of the burst fluence)[1]
- **Peak flux interval**: Time range of maximum gamma-ray emission[1]

**Spectral Flux Measurements**:
- **Peak bolometric flux**: Maximum gamma-ray flux during the burst[1]
- **Fluence**: Total energy flux integrated over the burst duration[1]
- **Energy fluence**: Measured in specific energy bands (e.g., 50-300 keV)[6]

**Physical Parameters** (calculated from spectral fits):
- **E_{i,p}**: Peak photon energy in the cosmological rest frame[2][1]
- **E_{iso}**: Isotropic-equivalent radiated energy during prompt phase[2][1]
- **L_{iso}**: Isotropic-equivalent luminosity during peak flux interval[2][1]

## Data Collection and Processing Methods

### Spectral Fitting Procedures

**Fermi-GBM Analysis**:[6]
- Uses rmfit software (version 3.3pr7 or later)
- Combines multiple detectors (NaI and BGO) for improved statistics
- Detector selection based on illumination angle ( â‰¤ 60Â° typically)

**Exclusion Criteria**:
- Short Gamma-Ray Bursts (SGRBs) removed from analysis[1]
- Bursts without adequate spectral fitting quality
- GRBs lacking redshift measurements

## Preprocessing Steps

### Spectral Model Selection
The study employs **ensemble stacking methods** combining Deep Neural Networks with Random Forest algorithms. Different spectral fitting approaches are tested:[1]

- **Band fluence**: Using Band model parameters from fluence measurements  
- **Band flux**: Using Band model parameters from peak flux measurements  
- **Comp fluence**: Using Comptonized model parameters from fluence measurements  
- **Comp flux**: Using Comptonized model parameters from peak flux measurements  
- **Combined models**: Using both fluence and flux parameters together[1]

### Data Validation
- **Model Performance Metrics**: RÂ² coefficient and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for goodness of fit[1]
- **Statistical Testing**: Two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests comparing pseudo-redshift and true redshift distributions[1]
- **Cross-validation**: Separate training and test datasets with 95% confidence intervals using bootstrapped methods[1]

## Dataset Limitations

### Sample Size Constraints
- **Limited Redshift Sample**: The authors acknowledge working with a "limited number of available predictors" - specifically 126 GBM LGRBs and 338 KW LGRBs with known redshift[1]
- **Spectral Information Gaps**: Not all spectral information is available for each GRB, leading to varying sample sizes across different model applications[1]

### Instrumental Biases
- **Energy Range Limitations**: Different energy windows between instruments (GBM: 8-1000 keV vs KW: 80-1200 keV) may introduce systematic effects[1]
- **Detection Bias**: Higher energy thresholds may preferentially select intrinsically brighter or closer bursts[8]
- **Spectral Model Dependencies**: Results may vary depending on choice between Band and Comptonized fitting functions[1]

### Temporal Coverage
- **Data Span Limitations**: KW data limited to 2005-2018 period[1]
- **Evolving Instrumental Capabilities**: Different detection sensitivities and analysis methods across the observation periods

### Redshift Distribution
- **High-z Limitations**: While GRBs are observed up to z = 8.2, the majority of the training sample likely concentrates at lower redshifts[1]
- **Selection Effects**: The requirement for spectroscopic redshift confirmation may bias toward brighter, more easily followed-up events

## Data Application in the Study

The curated dataset enables training of machine learning models to predict "pseudo-redshifts" for GRBs without known redshift measurements. The best-performing models achieve statistical consistency with true redshift distributions (p-values > 0.05 in Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests) and successfully reproduce key astrophysical correlations like the Amati and Yonetoku relations.[2][1]

The comprehensive spectral parameter database provides a foundation for advancing GRB cosmological applications, potentially enabling the use of gamma-ray bursts as standard candles for cosmological distance measurements.[2][1]
