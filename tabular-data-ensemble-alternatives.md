# Alternative Models for Deep Neural Network Ensembles 

Based on implementations using TensorFlow `DNNRegressor` models in a stacking ensemble for Band Fluence prediction, there exist several powerful alternative models that may improve predictive performance. The current strategy combines multiple `DNNRegressor` architectures with a RandomForest meta-learner, but modern machine learning provides compelling alternatives.

## **Gradient Boosting Models**

### **XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost**

These are among the most successful approaches for tabular data regression. Tree-based gradient boosting models frequently outperform neural networks on structured datasets ([1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10611362/), [2](https://neptune.ai/blog/when-to-choose-catboost-over-xgboost-or-lightgbm), [3](https://jurnal.kdi.or.id/index.php/bt/article/view/2530)):

- **XGBoost** delivers excellent performance for high-dimensional data, offering scalability, multiple loss functions, and robust cross-validation features ([1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10611362/)).
- **LightGBM** emphasizes computational efficiency, fast training, and strong performance with numerical and sparse data ([1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10611362/)).
- **CatBoost** provides strong handling of categorical variables and robustness to missing values or outliers, often performing well with minimal hyperparameter tuning ([2](https://neptune.ai/blog/when-to-choose-catboost-over-xgboost-or-lightgbm), [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10611362/)).

Example replacement for base models:

```python
base_models = [
    xgb.XGBRegressor(n_estimators=1000, learning_rate=0.08, max_depth=5),
    lgb.LGBMRegressor(n_estimators=1000, learning_rate=0.08, max_depth=7, num_leaves=100),
    CatBoostRegressor(iterations=1000, learning_rate=0.5, depth=10, verbose=False)
]
````

## **Modern Neural Network Architectures**

### **TabNet**

TabNet leverages sequential attention to identify relevant features, offering interpretability and competitive performance against gradient boosting methods. It is particularly suitable for astronomical data where feature importance (e.g., T90, Ep, Alpha, Beta, Sbolo) is of scientific interest ([4](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/tabnet/), [5](https://thedataexchange.media/neural-models-for-tabular-data/), [6](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/sv974x/deep_learning_models_to_do_regression_on_a/)).

### **PyTorch-based Models**

Adopting PyTorch enables access to specialized libraries:

* **PyTorch Tabular** implements architectures such as GANDALF, NODE, FT-Transformer, and AutoInt ([7](https://pytorch-tabular.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/01-Approaching%20Any%20Tabular%20Problem%20with%20PyTorch%20Tabular/), [8](https://pytorch-tabular.readthedocs.io), [9](https://github.com/manujosephv/pytorch_tabular)).
* **PyTorch Frame** provides infrastructure for mixed-type tabular data ([10](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch-frame)).

## **Foundation Models and Transformers**

Transformer-based architectures demonstrate growing relevance for tabular tasks:

* **TabPFN** is a foundation model effective with smaller datasets, often requiring less training data ([11](https://techxplore.com/news/2025-01-machine-algorithm-enables-faster-accurate.html)).
* **FT-Transformer** uses feature tokenization with transformer layers, showing strong regression performance ([12](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.03970v2)).

## **Hybrid Approaches**

### **Neural-Tree Hybrids**

Approaches such as **GrowNet** and **Neural Oblivious Decision Ensembles** combine interpretability of trees with neural flexibility ([13](https://deepgram.com/learn/deep-learning-gbms-tabular-data)).

### **Retrieval-Augmented Models**

**TabR** integrates deep learning with nearest-neighbor retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks ([14](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rhgIgTSSxW)).

## **Enhanced Ensemble Strategies**

### **Heterogeneous Ensembles**

Diverse ensembles may be built from both tree-based and neural models ([15](https://www.machinelearningmastery.com/ensemble-machine-learning-algorithms-python-scikit-learn/)):

```python
base_models = [
    XGBRegressor(),
    LGBMRegressor(), 
    CatBoostRegressor(),
    TabNetRegressor(),
    MLPRegressor()
]
```

### **Advanced Meta-Learners**

Final estimators such as Ridge, Lasso, or neural meta-learners may replace RandomForest for improved stacking performance ([16](https://machinelearningmastery.com/demystifying-ensemble-methods-boosting-bagging-and-stacking-explained/)).

## **Scikit-learn Alternatives**

Scikit-learn provides accessible options:

* **MLPRegressor**: a simpler alternative to TensorFlow DNNs ([17](https://www.aazuspan.dev/blog/building-autoencoders-with-scikit-learn/), [18](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neural_networks_supervised.html)).
* **Ensemble methods**: `HistGradientBoostingRegressor`, `VotingRegressor`, and `BaggingRegressor` ([19](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html), [20](https://datasciencehorizons.com/introduction-ensemble-learning-scikit-learn/)).

## **Recommendations for Astronomical Data**

Given the datasetâ€™s mixed numerical/categorical features and medium scale:

1. Begin with gradient boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) ([3](https://jurnal.kdi.or.id/index.php/bt/article/view/2530), [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10611362/)).
2. Explore **TabNet** for interpretability and scientific insight ([5](https://thedataexchange.media/neural-models-for-tabular-data/), [4](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/tabnet/)).
3. Leverage **CatBoost** for categorical feature handling ([2](https://neptune.ai/blog/when-to-choose-catboost-over-xgboost-or-lightgbm)).
4. Experiment with **TabPFN** for efficiency on smaller datasets ([11](https://techxplore.com/news/2025-01-machine-algorithm-enables-faster-accurate.html)).

Evidence suggests that for structured data, gradient boosting methods remain superior to conventional neural networks, while architectures such as TabNet provide deep learning benefits specifically tailored to tabular applications ([21](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1bqigwy/any_reason_to_not_use_pytorch_for_every_ml/), [13](https://deepgram.com/learn/deep-learning-gbms-tabular-data), [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.03970v2)).
