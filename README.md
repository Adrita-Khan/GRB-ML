# GRB-ML

This project uses Machine Learning to analyze Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) as potential cosmological standard candles, focusing on improving their standardization and refining empirical relations like the Amati and Yonetoku relations. By exploring correlations between observable quantities and derived cosmological parameters, we aim to constrain the Hubble constant and dark energy density. The goal is to enhance redshift calculations and contribute to understanding the universe's expansion.

##### Objectives

While the existing empirical relations for GRBs are useful, there is a need for more accurate and "tight" relations that can provide better standardization. Machine Learning can help identify these tighter relations and further probe cosmological models. The specific tasks are as follows:

- **Explore Correlations**: Use ML techniques to uncover deeper correlations between observable quantities and cosmological parameters, standardizing GRBs as cosmological candles.
- **Constrain Cosmological Parameters**: Using the correlations found, ML can help constrain key cosmological parameters, including the Hubble constant and dark energy density.

*This repository serves as a starting point for using Machine Learning to improve the standardization of GRBs as cosmological probes, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of the universe's expansion and the cosmic distance ladder.*
