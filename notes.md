'Redshift', 'T90', 'Alpha', 'Beta', 'Ep', 'Sbolo', these are the **column names** of the dataset, and they represent different features (variables) in the data that are used for the machine learning task (in this case, predicting **Redshift**). 
1. **Redshift**:

   * **Redshift** is a measure of the change in the frequency (or wavelength) of light emitted by an object due to its motion relative to the observer. It is commonly used in astronomy to measure the velocity at which an object (like a star or galaxy) is moving away from the observer. It is the **target variable** in this dataset, meaning it's what we are trying to predict using machine learning models.

2. **T90**:

   * **T90** refers to the duration of a gamma-ray burst (GRB), defined as the time it takes for 90% of the total energy to be released. It is a measure of the burst's duration, and it helps in characterizing the GRB event.

3. **Alpha**:

   * **Alpha** is a spectral index (spectral parameter) related to the energy spectrum of the gamma-ray burst (GRB). Itâ€™s used to describe the energy distribution of the emitted radiation. A negative alpha indicates that the radiation is more intense at lower energies.

4. **Beta**:

   * **Beta** is another spectral index related to the GRB, similar to Alpha. Beta helps characterize the decay rate of the GRB's energy spectrum in the higher energy range. Typically, the relationship between Alpha and Beta helps in the analysis of the GRB's emission.

5. **Ep**:

   * **Ep** is the **peak energy** in the gamma-ray spectrum of the burst. It represents the energy at which the spectrum reaches its maximum intensity. It's an important parameter to understand the energy dynamics of GRBs.

6. **Sbolo**:

   * **Sbolo** is the **total fluence** of the burst, representing the total energy output from the burst over its entire duration. This value is important in characterizing the overall energy emitted by a gamma-ray burst.

In summary:

* These are all **features** or **variables** that describe various characteristics of a gamma-ray burst (GRB), and they are used as **input features** in machine learning models. The goal is to use these features to predict the **Redshift**, which is the **target variable**.
